# Overture Reprise

Overture Reprise is a game engine written in c that exists I guess...

This is the third time I try to make this engine, but unlike previous atempts I now finally know what I'm doing... kinda. Overture is not trying to be the best game engine out there, and in fact will have many stupid things because I learned smt cool and used it in a stupid way. I took inspiration from the gldsrc and source engines although Overture is very different. I'm trying to make this old school ish but also new ish... simply said its a mess. I'm just doing this for fun.

## Features
